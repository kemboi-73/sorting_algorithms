# Project 0x1B - C Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This is a team project to be completed by the group consisting of two people.The project is based on sorting algorithms and understanding the concept of Big O notation to evaluate the time complexity of different algorithms.

## Background Context

Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science and programming. They enable us to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. The efficiency of sorting algorithms is measured using Big O notation, which gives us insights into how their performance scales with the size of the input data.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Understand and explain the concept of Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Select the most appropriate sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Know what constitutes a stable sorting algorithm.

## Project Requirements

- The project must be written in C programming language.
- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Code must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options (-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89).
- Code should adhere to the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- The standard library functions like printf, puts, etc., are not allowed, unless specified otherwise.
- The project must include a README.md file at the root of the folder.
- Function prototypes must be included in the header file "sort.h" and should be include guarded.
- The use of plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and any form of copying and pasting someone else's work will result in removal from the program.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, and each task requires the implementation of a specific sorting algorithm. Additionally, for each task, you need to write a file called "0-O," "1-O," "2-O," etc., depending on the task number. In these files, you are required to write the Big O notation for the time complexity of the implemented sorting algorithm in the best case, average case, and worst case scenarios.

The specific tasks to be completed are as follows:

1. Implement Bubble sort and write the corresponding Big O notations.
2. Implement Insertion sort and write the corresponding Big O notations.
3. Implement Selection sort and write the corresponding Big O notations.
4. Implement Quick sort using the Lomuto partition scheme and write the Big O notations.
5. Implement Shell sort using the Knuth sequence and do not write the Big O notations (as it is dependent on the size of the array and gap).
6. Implement Cocktail shaker sort for a doubly linked list and write the Big O notations.

## Tests

You can test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers by using a resource like Random.org.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and you should come up with your own solutions for each task.

## Project Deadline

The project will start on Jul 19, 2023, at 6:00 AM and must be completed and submitted by Jul 26, 2023, at 6:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline.
